Meltdown & Spectre

1. Spectre variant1
boundary check

2. Spectre variant2
branch target injection
happen at os kernel, 
Mitigation: Retpoline & IBRS, IBPB
Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation
Indirect Branch Prediction Barriers

3. Meltdown variant3
rogue data cache load
Mitigation: at linux kernel (KPTI)
Kernel Page Table Isolation

KAISER user space can not know where is the kernel space
