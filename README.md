# Model Checker Verification
We will use **Murphi model checker**. But there are several type and variations. Need to check which one fits best. 

1. DeNovo paper [http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/denovo/Pubs/11-pact-denovo.pdf](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/denovo/Pubs/11-pact-denovo.pdf) 
which verified its protocol versus MESI protocol from GEM5. It is mentioned that, just providing **SLICC** file could works. 

2. This website lists all the verification tools that could help. Search Murphi to get the links.
